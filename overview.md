# An Overview of Application Development

Application development is a complex and varied craft. It has many parts, each of which interacts with the other parts to make something truly great. We will begin our discussion at a high level and work our way down.

## Back-End and Front-End
Web development can generally be broken down into two parts: development on the back-end and development on the front-end. We will discuss the differences here.

### Back-End
*Back-end* normally means accessing and storing data. We do this using three parts:
-    Server
-    Application
-    Database

A *server* can be seen as something that makes transactions. When you visit a website in your web browser, a request is sent to a server for that website. The server takes the information from this request, does some processing, and then returns a response, which is normally in the form of a web page. In short, the server takes requests and gives responses.

An *application* represents all of the logic within an application. It does things like making sure form input is valid, adding information to and loading information from the database, and lots of other things. Think of the application as the controller of what happens within an application.

A *database* holds some data. For simplicity, think of it as lots of giant Excel spreadsheets, each with rows and columns. We can store information like user information, posts, comments, and other things here.

Together, these parts combine to be the *backend*. When people say they are *backend programmers*, these are the types of things they are talking about.

Common programming languages used for the backend are:
-	PHP
-	Ruby
-	Python

### Front-End
